This repository contains an example of inefficient vector usage in C++. The `bug.cpp` file demonstrates the problem, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides an optimized solution. The inefficient approach involves repeatedly erasing elements from the beginning of a vector, causing frequent reallocations and data copying, which leads to poor performance as the vector grows. The optimized solution uses a more suitable data structure or algorithm to avoid the overhead associated with this operation. This example highlights the importance of understanding the performance characteristics of data structures and algorithms to write efficient C++ code.
